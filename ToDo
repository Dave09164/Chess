	I have implemented a makeMove function in the Board class. 
	
	Next time I will need to ensure every piece follow the correct rules of chess
	from the validMoves function.

	Done some stuff but didn't write anything here because had to go get tested for
	the rona. SO I DID. Test results came back negative - no idea how but oh well.
	It's only been one day and I already forget what I have done lol.

	Improved the readability of the code and the piece movement functionality. 
	Focusing on pawn movement. 
		-Can move correctly and attack correctly
		
	Pawn seems to have all functionality. 
		-Moving, Attacking, Promotions etc.
	Storing captured pieces in an ArrayList.
	General game functionality working as expected.
	
	Focus on Bishop, Knight, Rook, and Queen tomorrow
	
	Scanner class is a piece of shit.

	Movement/Capturing for all pieces is working as expected except for King.
	Need to work out how king will be marked as CheckMate.
	Some logic already done. Needs finished. 
	
	Storing players and game needs to be implemented.
