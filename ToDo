	I have implemented a makeMove function in the Board class. 
	
	Next time I will need to ensure every piece follow the correct rules of chess
	from the validMoves function.

	^ Did not do previous days end task
	 
	Updated the move functionality to allow for user input to determine the move.
	
	Still need to ensure every piece follows the correct rules of chess.
	By updating validMoves function for each piece type/object.

	Done some stuff but didn't write anything here because had to go get tested for
	the rona. SO I DID. Test results came back negative - no idea how but oh well.
	It's only been one day and I already forget what I have done lol.

	Improved the readability of the code and the piece movement functionality. 
	Focusing on pawn movement. 
		-Can move correctly and attack correctly
		
	Pawn seems to have all functionality. 
		-Moving, Attacking, Promotions etc.
	Storing captured pieces in an ArrayList.
	General game functionality working as expected.
	
	Focus on Bishop, Knight, Rook, and Queen tomorrow
	
	Scanner class is a piece of shit.

	Movement/Capturing for all pieces is working as expected except for King.
	Need to work out how king will be marked as CheckMate.
	Some logic already done. Needs finished. 
	
	Storing players and game needs to be implemented.

	Back at it. Reviewing how everything works again. Corrected the movement input
	it is not letter number rather now number letter. Because that's absurd. 
	
	Have added a object Observer. The purpose of the observer is to ensure the 
	king does not move into a dangerous file/rank. Functionality does not end 
	with that. Other uses will be implemented in the future. 
	
	Once the dangerous Cells can be identified. The manoeuvre 'Castling' can be
	implemented. 'En-Passant' is still to be implemented. 
	
	Problem with current Observer function 'getAttackedRanks' is that it is
	returning all possible moves from the opposing side. Including Pawns, 
	even though all Pawns movements are not attacking movements. Pawn functions
	will need reviewed of a new function 'validCaptureMoves' will need
	created.
